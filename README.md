•	Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

Artemis Financial is a dynamic consulting firm specializing in crafting personalized financial plans encompassing savings, retirement, investments, and insurance. They have a vision to modernize their operations. The primary objective is to leverage cutting-edge software security measures to proactively identify and address any potential vulnerabilities within their web-based software application. Given the nature of Artemis Financial's services, safeguarding communications is of paramount importance, considering they handle client finances and sensitive information. 


•	What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?

Once I found my client’s software security vulnerabilities, I was able to successfully implement solutions to reinforce security. Coding securely is crucial to protect sensitive data, prevent cyber attacks, and maintain the integrity of software systems. By prioritizing software security, a company ensures trust among users, safeguards its reputation, and minimizes the risk of financial losses or legal liabilities due to data breaches or vulnerabilities. It enhances the overall well-being of the company by fostering customer confidence, complying with regulatory standards, and reducing the likelihood of disruptive incidents, thereby supporting long-term sustainability and growth.


•	What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

Refactoring the Application.properties file to enable HTTPS was challenging due to the restrictions of my operating system.

•	How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

I increased layers of security by addressing each vulnerability manually as well applying static testing. 

•	How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

I ensured that the software application was both functional and secure through iterations of refactoring and testing. To ensure no new vulnerabilities were introduced post-refactoring, I implemented an additional static test.

•	What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

Some tools that were extremely helpful in ensuring software security include, maven dependency checks, self-signed certificates, and checksum functions.  Resources include Oracle, CISA, NIST, and O’Reilly’s Iron-Clad Java: Building Secure Web Applications. These tools and resources coupled with secure coding practices will be helpful in future assignments.

•	Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

I believe my ability to identify security vulnerabilities as well as apply layers of security to secure a software application is on display in this assignment. I would show future employers the self-signed certificate, dependency check, and checksum function.
